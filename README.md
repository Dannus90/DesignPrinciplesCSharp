# Gamma Categorization

## Design patterns are divided into three categories.

### Creational Patterns
- Deal with creation (construction) of objects.
- Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection).
- Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step).

### Structural patterns
- Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members).
- Many patterns are wrapper that mimic the underlying class' interface
- Stress the importance of good API design.

### Behavorial patterns
- They are all difference; no central theme.
